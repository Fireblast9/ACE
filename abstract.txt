"How does arbitrary code execution exploit vulnerabilities, and what can it teach us about software security?"


The purpose of my thesis is to study arbitrary code execution (ACE), a technique where a malicious user can execute unintended code on an external machine.

As a case study, I intend to analyze the video game Pok√©mon Emerald (2004), which was written in C and ARM assembly.

This choice is driven by my personal interest in the topic and the fact that the game's full source code is available for consultation and study.
