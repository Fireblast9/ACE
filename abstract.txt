"How does arbitrary code execution exploit vulnerabilities in Pokémon Emerald/Pokémon/, and what can it teach us about software security?"


The purpose of my thesis is to study arbitrary code execution (ACE), a technique where a malicious user can supply and execute their own code on a target system. Understanding ACE is crucial to properly identify and mitigate vulnerabilities of software security.

As a case study, I intend to analyze the video game Pokémon Emerald (2004). The game, which is written in C and ARM assembly, provides a compelling example due to the availability of its fully decompiled source code.

This choice is motivated by my strong personal interest in the topic, combined with the game's suitability for illustrating ACE techniques in a real-world scenario. I believe this case study will provide valuable insights into the broader field of software security.
