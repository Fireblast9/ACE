https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1920261.1920269 - his work proposes a compiler-based transformation that removes or “gadgetizes” all free-branch instructions (like RET and indirect CALLs) in binaries. By eliminating the very gadgets that attackers rely on for return-oriented programming (ROP)—a common technique used to achieve arbitrary code execution—the technique significantly raises the bar for exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities and similar memory corruption flaws.
