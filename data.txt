General discussion

Hi Professors, I finally took the time to create this chat as I was instructed to (apologies for doing it this late, but the exam session took more fuel from me than what I anticipated). The title is still somewhat placeholder-y and in the upcoming weeks I plan on expanding the original draft of the "abstract" and writing out a bit more what I plan to talk about in the thesis, so to get your approval on the structure.
